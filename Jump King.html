            <h3>About the Game</h3>

                "Tactical Leaping Adventure - Jump King: There is a Smoking Hot Babe at the Top!" is a platforming challenge about struggling upwards in search of the legendary Smoking Hot Babe! This lonely adventure to reach The Top will demand full mastery of the technique of jumping. Just try to remember, with each fall there is a lesson to be learned...
            <br><br>
            Jump King includes two free expansions - ”New Babe+” and ”Ghost of the Babe”!

            <b>-Prepare for true high-stakes platforming!</b><br>
            The only way forward is up, and your only enemy is yourself! Tension rises with each jump when a single mistake means a long fall - and you have to get back up again yourself...
            <br><br>
            <b>-Hold to charge and release to leap away!</b><br>
            The seemingly simple act of jumping will take much practice to master.
            <br><br>
            <b>-Use your mind before you jump!</b><br>
            The obvious path is sometimes not the best, and once you are in the air there is no turning back...
            <br><br>
